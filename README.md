# DCY Tech Test

This is a github repository containing a clojure leiningen project that you will use in order to do the DCY Technical Test.

Please fork it, solve the tests in `src/io/dcy/tech_test/test_core.clj`

Follow the comments in this file and code the solutions until all the tests pass.

When you are done you can submit a Pull Request from your fork !

It should be quite simple, and you are asked to share you screen while doing the test.

You can ask any questions you like to the interviewer.

It shouldn't last more than 30 minutes.

Good luck !
